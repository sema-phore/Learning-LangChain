      "The Russo-Ukrainian war began in February 2014 and is ongoing. Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia occupied Crimea and annexed it from Ukraine. It then supported Russian separatist armed groups who started a war in the eastern Donbas region against Ukraine's military. In 2018, Ukraine declared the region to be occupied by Russia. The first eight years of conflict also involved naval incidents and cyberwarfare. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the country, starting the current phase of the war, the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II. The war has resulted in a refugee crisis and hundreds of thousands of deaths.\n",
      "In early 2014, the Euromaidan protests led to the Revolution of Dignity and the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Shortly after, pro-Russian protests began in parts of southeastern Ukraine, while unmarked Russian troops occupied Crimea. Russia soon annexed Crimea after a highly disputed referendum. In April 2014, Russian-backed militants seized towns and cities in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as independent states, starting the Donbas war. Russia covertly supported the separatists with its own troops, tanks and artillery, preventing Ukraine from fully retaking the territory. The International Criminal Court (ICC) judged that the war was both a national and international armed conflict involving Russia, and the European Court of Human Rights judged that Russia controlled the DPR and LPR from 2014 onward. In February 2015, Russia and Ukraine signed the Minsk II agreements, but they were never fully implemented in the following years. The Donbas war became a static conflict likened to trench warfare; ceasefires were repeatedly broken but the frontlines did not move.\n",
      "Beginning in 2021, there was a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine's borders, including within neighbouring Belarus. Russian officials repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine. Russia's president Vladimir Putin voiced expansionist views and challenged Ukraine's right to exist. He demanded that Ukraine be barred from ever joining the NATO military alliance. Ukraine had been officially a neutral country when the conflict began, but because of Russia's attacks it revived plans to join NATO. In early 2022, Russia recognised the DPR and LPR as independent states. While Russian troops surrounded Ukraine, its proxies stepped up attacks on Ukrainian forces in the Donbas.\n",
      "On 24 February 2022, Putin announced a \"special military operation\" to \"demilitarize and denazify\" Ukraine, claiming Russia had no plans to occupy the country. The Russian invasion that followed was internationally condemned; many countries imposed sanctions against Russia, and sent humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. In the face of fierce resistance, Russia abandoned an attempt to seize Kyiv in early April. In August, Ukrainian forces began liberating territories in the north-east and south. In September, Russia declared the annexation of four partially occupied provinces, which was internationally condemned. Since then, Russian offensives and Ukrainian counteroffensives have gained only small amounts of territory. The invasion has also led to attacks in Russia by Ukrainian and Ukrainian-backed forces, among them a cross-border offensive into Russia's Kursk region in August 2024. Russia has repeatedly carried out deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians far from the frontline. The UN Human Rights Office reported that Russia was committing severe human rights violations in occupied Ukraine. The ICC opened an investigation into war crimes and issued arrest warrants for Putin and several other Russian officials. Russia has repeatedly refused calls for a ceasefire.\n",

      "India’s position on the Russo-Ukrainian war, as stated in March 2022 parliamentary responses and at the United Nations, emphasized a consistent call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution through diplomacy and direct dialogue between the parties involved. India expressed concern over the humanitarian crisis and provided assistance to affected civilians. The government highlighted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s communications with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging continued negotiations. India maintained a neutral stance, stressing respect for international law, the UN Charter, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. During a 25 February 2022 Security Council meeting, India’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador T.S. Tirumurti, reiterated the importance of dialogue, condemned the abandonment of diplomacy, and explained that these principles informed India’s decision to abstain from the vote on condemnation of Russia and demanding withdrawal of forces.\n",
      "During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Indian-Russian economic and diplomatic ties saw significant growth, occurring in contrast to Western condemnation of and sanctions on Russia. India supplied unilateral support for Ukraine with humanitarian aid. India's circumvention of Western sanctions to purchase heavily discounted Russian oil and fertilizer, its supply of dual-use technology to Russia, and its repeated abstentions from condemning Russia's invasion negatively impacted Ukrainian ties to India, and complicated Western diplomatic interactions with India, although India is still seen by many in the west to be a 'perfect' and impartial mediator. On the other hand, India has criticised Europe and the US for double standards on its purchases of Russian Crude Oil.\n",

      "== Trade ==\n",
      "After the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and because of international sanctions against Russia, it started to provide oil and chemical fertilisers at discounted rate to India, increasing India-Russia bilateral trade volume from $13 billion [2021-2022] to $27 billion within 2022 making it the largest oil and fertiliser supplier to India. During 2022–23, India became one of the largest trade partners of Russia, primarily through the purchase of Russian oil. In August 2024, India became the largest importer of Russian oil, overtaking China. India imported 35-40% of its oil from Russia in 2024, up from 3% in 2021.\n",
      "In December 2023, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov over a five-day visit, praising the two countries' \"all-time high\" trading volume, praising the trade as \"balanced\", \"sustainable\" and providing \"fair market access\".\n",
      "On 12 December 2024, Russian state oil company Rosneft agreed to supply nearly 500,000 barrels of crude oil per day to Indian private refiner Reliance, the largest oil supply deal between the two countries in their trade history.\n",
      "In July 2025, India became Ukraine's largest diesel supplier, providing 15.5% of imports—up from 1.9% a year earlier, according to NaftoRynok. Exports averaged 2,700 tonnes daily, routed mainly via Romania and Turkey. The fuel aided Ukraine and, according to Indian media, analysts suggest that some of it may have been refined from Russian-origin crude although the official sourcing data remained undisclosed. This occurred while the U.S. imposed tariffs on India over its Russian oil imports. In July 2025, the US announced its first \"secondary tariff,\" targeting India to penalize its trade with Russia. Beginning 27 August 2025, Indian exports have faced an extra 25% tariff or a total baseline tariff of 50%. \n",
      "In August 2025, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused India of profiting from reselling Russian oil, saying \"This is what I would call the Indian arbitrage — buying cheap Russian oil, reselling it as product. They’ve made $16 billion in excess profits — some of the richest families in \n",

      "There have been several rounds of peace talks to end the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war since it began with Russia's invasion in February 2022. Russia's president Vladimir Putin seeks recognition of all occupied land as Russian, for Russia to be given all of the regions it claims but does not fully occupy, guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO, curtailment of Ukraine's military, and the lifting of sanctions against Russia. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeks a full withdrawal of Russian troops, the return of prisoners and kidnapped Ukrainian children, prosecution of Russian leaders for war crimes, and security guarantees to prevent further Russian aggression.\n",
      "The first meeting between Russian and Ukrainian officials was held four days after the invasion began, on 28 February 2022, in Belarus, and ended without result. Later rounds of talks took place in March 2022 on the Belarus–Ukraine border and in Antalya, Turkey. Negotiations in Turkey proposed that Ukraine would abandon plans to join NATO and have limits placed on its military, while having security guarantees from Western countries, and not being required to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. Negotiations halted due to disagreements over key points, Russia's proposed veto on Ukraine's defense, doubts about Russia's sincerity, and the Bucha massacre.\n",
      "Renewed negotiations began in 2025 after Donald Trump became president of the United States. Trump's administration formulated peace plans generally favorable towards Russia: these offers have however been met with refusal from both Russia and Ukraine. European countries have been more aligned with Ukrainian proposals, and have planned for a ceasefire guarded by a \"coalition of the willing\" with troops in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly refused calls for a ceasefire, and Putin has repeatedly spurned negotiations with Zelenskyy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Background ==\n",
      "Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom are signatories to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum political agreement, providing security assurances to Ukraine. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents. Russia reaffirmed this assurance in 2009. After the Russian occupation of Crimea began in 2014, Putin claimed that the Revolution of Dignity had created a new political entity and any prior agreement with Ukraine was therefore void.\n",
      "Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia has repeatedly engineered frozen conflicts to block the expansion of NATO or the European Union into the former Soviet sphere of influence. Conflicts are deemed \"frozen\" when fighting has stopped but no political resolution has been achieved. In 2014, Russia orchestrated separatist movements in Ukraine, and Russian proxy forces began the Donbas war. After Ukraine recovered significant territory up to August 2014, Russia intervened with conventional forces, leading to negotiated ceasefires through the Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015. These ceasefires had potential to freeze the conflict, but sporadic offensives by Russia-backed separatists continued. Although Russia was a party to the Minsk agreements, it later denied any obligations, claiming to have only been a mediator between Ukraine and separatist forces. In total, according to military analysts, Russia has broken 190 agreements signed with Ukraine and the international community.\n",
      "In the lead-up to the invasion, Russia's president Vladimir Putin repeatedly attacked Ukraine's right to exist and referred to Ukraine as \"historically Russian lands\". In his July 2021 essay \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians\", he claimed there is \"no historical basis\" for the \"idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians\". On 24 February 2022, Russia began its invasion of Ukraine as an escalation of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War.\n",
